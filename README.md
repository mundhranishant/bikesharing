## General Information
- The objective of this project is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables, which can help the management understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
- The background revolves around a bike-sharing provider seeking to understand the demand dynamics after a considerable dip in revenues due to the ongoing pandemic.
- The business problem focuses on predicting the demand for shared bikes among the people after the quarantine situation ends, facilitating the company to prepare and strategize accordingly.
- The dataset used includes daily bike rental records along with weather and seasonal information.

## Conclusions
- Temperature and season have significant positive effects on bike rental demand, with higher rentals observed during warmer months and specific seasons like Summer and Fall.
- Weather conditions greatly influence demand, with clear to partly cloudy conditions favoring higher rentals, while adverse weather conditions significantly reduce demand.
- The year-on-year analysis indicates a growing trend in bike rental demand, suggesting an increase in popularity or service expansion.
- Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression helped in refining the model by addressing multicollinearity and enhancing predictive accuracy.
